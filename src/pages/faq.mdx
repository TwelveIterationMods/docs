<FAQ question="Updates and Porting" icon="mdi:chevron-double-up" iconClass="text-orange-600" class="mt-5">
Generally, I always target the latest version of Minecraft. I also provide long-term-support (LTS) for the latest
minor release of the previous major version.

**The current LTS version is 1.19.2**. This is an exception to the rule, as 1.19.2 marks the last version before
Mojang's recent version policy change. I additionally backport to 1.20.1 and 1.18.2 on rare exceptions.

There currently is a backlog of mods still waiting to be ported to newer Minecraft versions, and there is no ETA on
when that will happen. Mods that I no longer plan to update will have "Discontinued" in their title.

</FAQ>

<FAQ question="Configuration" icon="mdi:gear" iconClass="text-gray-600" class="mt-5">
The configuration files for my mods can be found in the config folder of your Minecraft instance. I do not use Forge's
world configs, instead, server-side configs are included in the normal `-common.toml` file.

To edit configurations ingame, you can install [Configured](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured)
on Forge, or [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) on Fabric.

When editing config files for Forge at runtime, do not use Notepad++, as it currently leads to issues with Forge's
config reloading and is likely to corrupt your config file.

<FAQ question="Love and Support" icon="mdi:heart" iconClass="text-red-600" class="mt-5">

<FAQ question="Further Help" icon="mdi:help" iconClass="text-cyan-600" class="mt-5">
If your question is related to a specific mod, check the information on the mod's page.

If that still does not answer your question, you have the following options:

-   If you are getting a crash or a bug, report it to the mod's GitHub repository (`Submit Issues & Feedback` link on mod page).
-   If you need support in general or have a short question needing a simple answer, you can use the `#help` or `#support` channel in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/VAfZ2Nau6j).
