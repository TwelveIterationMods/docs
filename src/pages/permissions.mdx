# Permissions

**Last Update:** December 29, 2023

<div class="grid lg:grid-cols-3 gap-2">

<PermissionBadge label="Modpacks" icon="mdi:check-circle" iconClass="text-green-600">
Use in modpacks is allowed on all platforms.

- Attribution is not required.
- Do not use the mods' names in your pack title.
- Do not ask for express permission.
</PermissionBadge>

<PermissionBadge label="Media" icon="mdi:check-circle" iconClass="text-green-600">
Use in videos or similar media is allowed on all platforms.

- Attribution is not required.
- Do not miscredit the mods.
- Do not link to unauthorized repost sites.
</PermissionBadge>

<PermissionBadge label="Republishing" icon="mdi:cancel" iconClass="text-red-600">
Generally, publicly republishing mod files or associated material is not allowed.

- See below for exceptions.
</PermissionBadge>

</div>

<div class="grid gap-4 mt-4">
<PermissionCard label="Republishing on Localized Platforms (such as Chinese mod forums)" icon="mdi:translate" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
You are allowed to translate the mod description and repost it on your local platform, under the following conditions:

- You indicate that it is an unofficial repost not associated with the original author
- You do not re-upload any actual mod files and instead link back to the original sources (CurseForge or Modrinth)
- You do so non-commercially, i.e. without direct or indirect monetary gain or purpose
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="Rehosting mod files as part of a modpack" icon="mdi:archive-refresh" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
Some modpack platforms do not have the ability to download mods from their official sources (CurseForge, Modrinth) and
may require bundling the actual mod files directly.

In these cases, you are allowed to bundle the mod files as part of your modpack, as long as you do so in good faith,
i.e. don't attempt to abuse this exception to plainly republish the mods under the guise of a modpack that doesn't
offer anything else of value.

An example for this is the Steam Workshop, where mods are often bundled together to maintain better control over when updates are pushed.

Platforms that do have the ability to download mods from their official sources should make use of those instead of
bundling the mod files directly.
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="Publishing Forks" icon="mdi:source-fork" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
I allow forks to be published publicly as long as they meet some requirements:

- You are maintaining a version that I've chosen to stop supporting, or you want to implement a spin-off feature that I have rejected.
- Essentially, there should be a tangible reason you're forking the mod that isn't just for the sake of republishing it.
- You choose a name that is not easily confused with the original mod's name
  - Do not name it the exact same (e.g. "Waystones")
  - Do not use "edition-style" prefixes or suffixes (e.g. "Waystones (Bedrock Edition)" or "Bedrock Waystones")
  - Do not use any prefixes or suffixes that seem like an enhancement or endorsed spin-off (e.g. "Waystones: Reloaded" or "Waystones: Carrot Edition")
- You design a logo that is not easily confused with the original mod's logo
- Your name and logo should not give an impression of being an official version related to the original mod

Contact me ([Discord](https://discord.gg/VAfZ2Nau6j), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth), [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/blaytheninth/projects)) if you intend to publish a fork. 
Mod Hosting platforms generally require the original author's permission for publishing forks, and I would also like to know about them just in case any problems or user confusions come up.

Sometimes a fork may not even be the best solution, and we could instead find a way to extend my mods' API and have you release an addon instead!

If your fork is not published publicy, i.e. only shared with your friends, family or community, you can do whatever you wish as long as your users are aware that you've made changes to the mod.

<PermissionCard label="Versions prior to Minecraft 1.17" icon="mdi:folder-open" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
Versions prior to Minecraft 1.17 were licensed under different licenses (mainly the MIT License) and are therefore
exempt from many of the rules outlined here. Review the terms of the license the version was released under
(which should still be traceable on GitHub).

However, while I cannot enforce these rules on those versions, I do
ask that you respect them to the extent possible. The rules are mainly in place to avoid plain misleading
re-uploads by uncaring parties and to avoid confusion for users trying to find the correct mod to download or report
issues to.
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="Asset Exceptions" icon="mdi:file-image" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
Some assets are exempt from the above rules.

- Obviously I cannot claim ownership of any textures that are clearly derivatives of Minecraft's own textures.
- The Return Scroll and Warp Stone item icons in Waystones are by [@JoeCreates](https://twitter.com/JoeCreates)
  and were publicly released under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license [here](https://opengameart.org/content/roguelikerpg-items).
- The Bound Scroll and Warp Scroll are derivatives of those item icons and therefore fall under the same license.
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="I found something breaking these guidelines" icon="mdi:hand-pointing-up" iconClass="text-yellow-200" class="mt-5">
I don't have time nor do I want to spend the effort and drama of getting people to respect these terms. This is more so
an outline for platforms to follow in their moderation when it comes to my mods, or for developers to follow if they
want to stay friends with me. ðŸ˜Š

If you actually find a blatant violation you can let me know, but there's also a good chance that it stems from before
these terms came into effect (pre Minecraft 1.17).

Don't act on my behalf! If something is actually posing an issue, I will likely find out about it anyways and try to
get it resolved.
