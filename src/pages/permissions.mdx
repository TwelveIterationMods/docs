<div class="grid lg:grid-cols-3 gap-2">

<PermissionBadge label="Modpacks" icon="mdi:check-circle" iconClass="text-green-600">
Use in modpacks is allowed on all platforms.

- Attribution is not required.
- Do not use the mods' names in your pack title.
- Do not ask for express permission.
</PermissionBadge>

Use in videos or similar media is allowed on all platforms.

</PermissionBadge>

<PermissionBadge label="Republishing" icon="mdi:cancel" iconClass="text-red-600">
Generally, publicly republishing mod files or associated material is not allowed.

- See below for exceptions.
</PermissionBadge>

</div>

<div class="grid gap-4 mt-4">
<PermissionCard label="Republishing on Localized Platforms (such as Chinese mod forums)" icon="mdi:translate" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
You are allowed to translate the mod description and repost it on your local platform, under the following conditions:

- You indicate that it is an unofficial repost not associated with the original author
- You do not re-upload any actual mod files and instead link back to the original sources (CurseForge or Modrinth)
- You do so non-commercially, i.e. without direct or indirect monetary gain or purpose
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="Rehosting mod files as part of a modpack" icon="mdi:archive-refresh" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
Some modpack platforms do not have the ability to download mods from their official sources (CurseForge, Modrinth) and
may require bundling the actual mod files directly.

An example for this is the Steam Workshop, where mods are often bundled together to maintain better control over when updates are pushed.

Therefore, you are explicitly permitted to redistribute the mod files as part of a modpack on the following platforms:
- Steam Workshop (for my Project Zomboid mods)

Platforms that do have the ability to download mods from their official sources should make use of those instead of
bundling the mod files directly. If you are looking to redistribute my mods on a platform that does not have this ability and is not listed above, feel free to reach out.
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="Publishing Forks" icon="mdi:source-fork" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
Unless I've given express permission, I do not allow forks to be published publicly.

If you have been granted express permission by me, or are basing your work on a version that was released under a more permissive license, the following conditions still apply:

- You choose a name that is not easily confused with the original mod's name
  - Do not name it the exact same (e.g. "Waystones")
  - Do not use "edition-style" prefixes or suffixes (e.g. "Waystones (Bedrock Edition)" or "Bedrock Waystones")
  - Do not use any prefixes or suffixes that seem like an enhancement or endorsed spin-off (e.g. "Waystones: Reloaded" or "Waystones: Carrot Edition")
- You design a logo that is not easily confused with the original mod's logo
- Your name and logo should not give an impression of being an official version related to the original mod

In either case, please also contact me to make me aware of the fork ([Discord](https://discord.gg/VAfZ2Nau6j), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth), [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/blaytheninth/projects)), 
just in case any problems or user confusions come up. Sometimes a fork may not even be the best solution, and we could instead find a way to extend my mods' API and have you release an addon instead!

If your fork is not published publicy, i.e. only shared with your friends, family or community, you can do whatever you wish as long as your users are aware that you've made changes to the mod.
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="Asset Exceptions" icon="mdi:file-image" iconClass="text-yellow-600" class="mt-5">
Some assets are exempt from the above rules.

- Obviously I cannot claim ownership of any textures that are clearly derivatives of Minecraft's own textures.
- The Return Scroll and Warp Stone item icons in Waystones are by [@JoeCreates](https://twitter.com/JoeCreates)
  and were publicly released under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license [here](https://opengameart.org/content/roguelikerpg-items).
- The Bound Scroll and Warp Scroll are derivatives of those item icons and therefore fall under the same license.
</PermissionCard>

<PermissionCard label="I found something breaking these guidelines" icon="mdi:hand-pointing-up" iconClass="text-yellow-200" class="mt-5">
Please don't act on my behalf. Some people may have been granted exceptions to these terms that you may not be aware of.

If you find something to be in violation of these guidelines, reach out to me and I can take it from there.

Note that I will take appropriate action to anyone infringing on my rights, including but not limited to DMCA takedowns.
