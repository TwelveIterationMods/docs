## Releases for Minecraft 1.21.5

---

<NoteBox title="Older worlds may not migrate correctly">
Minecraft is currently undergoing major changes in how data is stored, which makes forward-compatibility of older worlds tricky for mods.

There is a good chance your older worlds will not migrate correctly to 1.21.5.

If you choose to upgrade an old world, it is **strongly recommended** to make a backup of your world before you try updating to any 1.21.5 releases!
</NoteBox>

<NoteBox title="Cooking for Blockheads and Ex Compressum on Fabric" color="error">
Fabric has not yet re-added its extra models API, which these mods depend on. Therefore they are only available for NeoForge at the moment.
