## Releases for Minecraft 1.21.5

---

<NoteBox title="Older worlds may not migrate correctly">
Minecraft is currently undergoing major changes in how data is stored, which makes forward-compatibility of older worlds tricky for mods.

There is a good chance your older worlds will not migrate correctly to 1.21.5.

If you choose to upgrade an old world, it is **strongly recommended** to make a backup of your world before you try updating to any 1.21.5 releases!

<NoteBox title="Cooking for Blockheads and Ex Compressum on Fabric" color="error">
Fabric has not yet re-added its extra models API, which these mods depend on.
</NoteBox>

<NoteBox title="Updates for Minecraft Forge" color="info">
- Mod updates for Minecraft Forge may be delayed. **It is recommended to switch to NeoForge or Fabric.**
