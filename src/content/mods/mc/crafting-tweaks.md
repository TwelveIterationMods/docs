This mod adds buttons to many supported Crafting Tables (including modded ones) allowing you to quickly rotate, balance or clear the crafting grid.

Additionally, holding shift on the balance button you can also quickly spread a single stack over the entire grid, right-clicking the result slot will craft en entire stack, and there's a keybind for compressing stacks of items to its 9x9 or 4x4 recipe through a key press.
