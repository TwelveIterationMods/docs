Crafting for Blockheads is a customizable workbench mod that combines ideas from Cooking for Blockheads and opens them up to wider areas of crafting.

In its default configuration, it provides a multiblock workshop that can be used to easily craft common items.

However, the workshop can be fully customized by modpacks, allowing for entirely new crafting systems to be created within.
