This mod provides various tweaks and features to the Minecraft chat while staying close to the look and feel of the Vanilla chat.
It is only installed on the client.

Chat Tweaks is not compatible with MineTogether since MineTogether adds its own chat replacement.
You can safely remove MineTogether if you do not wish to use its features.
