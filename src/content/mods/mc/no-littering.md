This mod removes Leaf Litter from world generation. Instead, you can obtain leaf litter by punching trees, which has a chance of spawning it around the tree.

- Removes leaf litter from world generation
- Punching trees creates leaf litter around them
- Leaf litter piles up naturally as you keep punching
- Configurable chance for leaf litter to be created when punching trees
