Have you ever wondered what would happen if instead of dying in the void, you just kept falling?
Turns out you just come back out from the top (and the fall doesn't even kill you due to magic miracle power).

Instead of dying in the void, you will fall back down from the sky.
Despite the large falling height, you can still survive as long as you had full health when landing.
