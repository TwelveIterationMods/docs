Good news everyone, I've found the secrets to fixing your Minecraft experience.
I've bundled them in this mod.

This mod adds a bunch of optional tweaks to improve the Quality of Life during gameplay.
Tweaks can be individually enabled or disabled and configured.

Many of the tweaks are disabled by default, so make sure to enable the features you want for the most bestest experience possible.
