This mod adds additional bone meal variants that will speed up your cumbersome farming acts.
By using compressed bone meal, you can grind that one plant that you need lots of much quicker.
If you want to go way over the top, extremely compressed bone meal will have you covered - with its ability of applying a more than half a stack of bone meal in one go!
