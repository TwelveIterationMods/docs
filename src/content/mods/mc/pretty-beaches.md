This mod adjusts water physics when digging sand near water in an attempt to prevent ugly appearances of flowing water.
This means you can go dig up that sand you really needed without having to worry about ruining the environment.

Note that this mod will create water for free, so it's not really suited for cases where water is meant to be limited.
