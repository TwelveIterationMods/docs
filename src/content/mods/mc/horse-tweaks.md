This mod adds various saddle upgrades to improve the abilities of your horses, as well as some minor subtle tweaks aiming to reduce horse frustration. Upgrades can be applied to saddles by crafting a saddle along with the appropriate items.

**Info for SevTech users:** The upgraded saddle recipes get removed by CraftTweaker (along with the normal saddle recipe) right now.
You can enable some of them in the config to work without the upgrade though (or just grab the items from creative mode).
There is also a [CraftTweaker script by wooby_6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMNaX4MKkiHLGahdMA5z_4m_I_d8aQSk/view) that will fix the recipes in SevTech.
Download the file and place it into the scripts folder.
