This mod adds configurable rules for controlling whether a block can be broken. Rules allow for granular control through conditions and even modifiers (such as costing xp or items). **This mod does not enable any unbreakable rules by default.**

Modpack developers or server owners must configure the mod, e.g. by enabling the "waystones:generated_waystones" ruleset. **This mod is useless unless configured by a modpack or server owner.**
