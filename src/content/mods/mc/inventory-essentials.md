This mod adds a few inventory control enhancements that have initially been introduced in mods like Inventory Tweaks and Mouse Tweaks, but keeps it limited to only the most essential functionality. This means it can be used alongside other mods that add inventory features, such as Quark or Inventory Sorter, without having to worry about clashes in functionality. As no default behaviour is overriden by this mod, it can be used Plug-and-Play without having to worry about configurations first.
