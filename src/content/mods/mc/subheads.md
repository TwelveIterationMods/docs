This is a Headcrumbs addon that adds the skins of your Twitch subscribers to the Headcrumbs mobs.

It can be used with services like https://whitelist.gorymoon.se, but it can basically read from any compatible whitelist file located somewhere on the internet.

Each line in the file has to contain one username, similar to how whitelists were handled prior to the change to UUIDs.
The URLs to fetch the whitelist from are defined in the configuration file.
