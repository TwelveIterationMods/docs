Allows players to share YouTube links for music in an immersive manner to those nearby.

This mod will make requests to a web server operated by me in order to use the YouTube API to extract a title and duration for the YouTube links posted.

This request will be made against e.g. https://zedspace.eiradir.net/pz/media/youtube/dQw4w9WgXcQ from your server. In a future update, I will make this configurable so you could host your own resolver instead.
