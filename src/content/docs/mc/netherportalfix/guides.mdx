### Portals are still spawning in a 1:8 ratio

NetherPortalFix does not change the spawn behaviour of Nether Portals. 

It instead remembers which portal a player entered the dimension from, 
and returns them to that same portal when they go back through where they came from.

### Players are still coming out of the wrong portal

Something else in your modpack may be conflicting with NetherPortalFix.

Certain performance mods or mods that otherwise override the implementations of dimensional travel may cause NetherPortalFix to not function correctly.
