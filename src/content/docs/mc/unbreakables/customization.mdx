### Providing rulesets through datapacks

This is mainly useful for modders, since regular users can simply define rules within the config files.

Mods or datapacks can include ruleset json files under `data/<namespace>/unbreakables/<path>.json`, which allows players to enable the ruleset through the `rulesets` config option.

Example ruleset from Waystones:
```json
{
  "rules": [
    "[is_tag(waystones:waystones), is_not_state(origin, player)] refuse($chat.waystones.cannot_break_waystone)"
  ]
}
```
