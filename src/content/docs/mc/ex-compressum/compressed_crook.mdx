The Compressed Crook works just like a regular Wooden Crook, except it's SUPER FREAKING FAST.

## Crafting

Put four regular crooks in the shape of a crook to get your SUPER FREAKING FAST crook.

## Enchantments

SUPER FREAKING FAST ISN'T FAST ENOUGH FOR YOU?!?!? ?!?!?!?!?

I mean, Efficiency will probably work?

But a more useful enchantment is Silk Touch, since that will get you leaves and it's probably cheaper than shears.
