The Chicken Stick is a legendary hammer with infinite durability, however, due to the softness of the chicken's head it seems to only really work on the basic hammerable blocks.

## Crafting

Just poke a chicken with a stick.

But you might want to come prepared. I have a feeling the chicken might not cooperate...
