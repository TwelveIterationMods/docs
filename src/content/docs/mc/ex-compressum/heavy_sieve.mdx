The Heavy Sieve allows sifting of [Compressed Blocks](#compressed_block) with a small loss. It requires a suitable [mesh](iron_mesh) to function.

## Crafting

<RecipeContainer>
  <CraftingRecipe recipe="excompressum:oak_heavy_sieve" />
  <CraftingRecipe recipe="excompressum:spruce_heavy_sieve" />
  <CraftingRecipe recipe="excompressum:birch_heavy_sieve" />
  <CraftingRecipe recipe="excompressum:dark_oak_heavy_sieve" />
  <CraftingRecipe recipe="excompressum:acacia_heavy_sieve" />
  <CraftingRecipe recipe="excompressum:jungle_heavy_sieve" />
</RecipeContainer>


## Usage

Right-clicking the Heavy Sieve with a mesh will insert it. 
It can be retrieved by shift-right-clicking the block with an empty hand. 

Once a mesh has been inserted, the sieve can be right clicked with siftable blocks to sift them.

## Ex Nihilo

In Ex Nihilo Omnia, an [Iron Mesh](excompressum:Iron Mesh) is required to sift blocks. 
Any lower level mesh will break instantly on use in a Heavy Sieve.

In Ex Nihilo Adscensio, any mesh will work, as meshes in Adscensio have no durability and only split the loot table.
