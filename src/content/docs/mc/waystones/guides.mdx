### How to disable xp cost?

In recent versions of Waystones, distance-based xp cost is disabled by default.
Dimensional warps will still cost XP as governed by the `dimensionalWarpXpCost` config option.

Set `maximumBaseXpCost` and `dimensionalWarpXpCost` to 0 in the config file.

### How to enable xp cost?

Set `waystoneXpCostMultiplier` to `1` and ensure `maximumBaseXpCost` is not set to `0` in the config file.

There are more xpCostMultiplier options for the different types of teleportation, so read through the config file to understand all possible options.

### Warp Stone stuck at millions of seconds

This issue has been fixed in recent versions.

If you are in 1.18.2, 1.19.2, or 1.20.1 and later, **make sure you are on the latest version of Waystones**.

If you are still encountering this on the latest release of one of the above versions, your server's time is likely not in sync with reality.
Contact your server administrator to fix this.

If you are encountering this on versions prior to 1.18.2, 1.19.2, or 1.20.1, or you're not running the latest version of Waystones on those versions,
the only way to reset the cooldown is by right-clicking the warp stone while in creative mode or asking your server administrator to manually edit your player data.
The data in question will be located in `world/playerdata/<uuid>.dat`, can be opened using an NBT Editor, and the fields in question are located at `/BalmData/WaystonesData`.
Removing the cooldown fields or setting them to 0 will reset the cooldown.

### Waystones disappear when placed

Either you are a non-op within the spawn protection area, or Waystones is not properly installed on your server.

Note that Waystones is a mod for Forge/Fabric/NeoForge. Your server needs to be running one of those mod loaders for Waystones to work.

### Waystones cannot be crafted

Either the recipe has been changed or disabled in your pack, or Waystones is not properly installed on your server.

I recommend installing a mod like [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) to be able to view up-to-date recipes ingame.

Note that Waystones is a mod for Forge/Fabric/NeoForge. Your server needs to be running one of those mod loaders for Waystones to work.

### Waystones cannot be used

You are most likely a non-op within the spawn protection area. Minecraft blocks all player interaction within the spawn protection area.

Contact your server administrator to change the spawn protection area or to move the waystone out of the protected area.

### How do I move a waystone to the start or end of the list?

You can hold shift while clicking the up/down button to instantly move a waystone to the start or end of the list.

### How do I remove Waystones that no longer exist from the list?

- For normal waystones, you can hold shift in the selection screen to enable the delete button and remove it from your own list.
- For global waystones, you need to be in creative mode to do the above, and the removal will be propagated to all players.

- For sharestones, the only way to remove a corrupt entry is by removing it from the `waystones.dat` file using an NBT editor.
The file is located in the world folder at `data/waystones.dat`. In multiplayer, this will be in the server's world folder.

### Waystones are not generating in villages

Waystones only generate in villages generated through Vanilla Minecraft or certain supported mods (e.g. Repurposed Structures).
Other generation mods may interfere with the generation of waystones in villages, especially ones that add new village types.

Due to Minecraft limitations, it is not possible for Waystones to reliably generate in all modded village types.

### How do I disable or change the crafting recipes?

Crafting recipes can be overwritten through data packs or through the use of mods like [CraftTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker).

Refer to the respective guides (e.g. Minecraft Wiki for data packs, or CraftTweaker documentation) to learn the details.

### How do I export a waystone in a structure?

Waystones initialize and receive a unique ID when they are loaded, so simply exporting a waystone block within a structure would result in all generated waystones having the same identity.

You need to un-initialize the waystone before exporting the structure. To do so, right-click it with a bamboo stick while in creative mode.

Make sure to save the structure before reloading the world or chunk as that would re-initialize the waystone.
