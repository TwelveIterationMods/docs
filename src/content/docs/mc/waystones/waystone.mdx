The waystone is a block that can be crafted and placed, or found in the world. Players can activate waystones, which
will allow them to teleport back to those waystones using items such as the Warp Stone or Warp Scrolls. Waystones can
also be used to travel between each other.

Players in Creative Mode can configure a Waystone to be "global". This means the Waystone will be automatically
activated for every other player and is useful for Server Hubs. See also [Sharestones](sharestone) for an alternative to global waystones.

Waystones can be broken with a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe to be able to move one without everyone losing access to
it.
