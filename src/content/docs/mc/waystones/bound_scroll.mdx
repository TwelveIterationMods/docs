The bound scroll is a special kind of warp scroll that can be tied to a specific [Waystone](waystone) by right-clicking the waystone
with it.

It can be used to teleport back to that specific waystone, or it could be given to another player and allow them to
easily get to the bound waystone even if they have not activated it yet.

### Crafting
    
Bound scrolls are crafted by placing a warp scroll inside the center slot of a waystone.

<NoteBox>
On older versions, Bound Scrolls had a separate recipe and could be bound by right-clicking a waystone.

Use a recipe viewing mod like JEI to see the correct recipe for your version.

### Usage

- Right-click a waystone to bind the Bound Scroll to a Waystone.
- Hold right-click to teleport to the Waystone bound to this Bound Scroll.
