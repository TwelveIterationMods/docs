Attuned Shards are attuned to a specific [Warp Plate](warp_plate) and form the connection between two Warp Plates
when inserted into one another.

Each newly placed Warp Plate comes with one Attuned Shard by default, but you can create
additional shards by placing another set of ingredients into the Warp Plate.

When the Warp Plate that an attuned shard is attuned to is broken, the shard will lose its attunement. It cannot be reused.

### Crafting

Additional attuned shards can be created within a Warp Plate by placing a piece of Flint in the center and four pieces
of [Warp Dust](warp_dust) around it.

<InterfaceScreen name="Warp Plate Screen" screen={warpPlateImage.src}>
    <MinecraftItem item="waystones:warp_dust" class="left-[160px] top-[34px]" />
    <MinecraftItem item="waystones:warp_dust" class="left-[104px] top-[90px]" />
    <MinecraftItem item="minecraft:flint" class="left-[160px] top-[90px]" />
    <MinecraftItem item="waystones:warp_dust" class="left-[216px] top-[90px]" />
    <MinecraftItem item="waystones:warp_dust" class="left-[160px] top-[146px]" />
</InterfaceScreen>

### Usage

- Place the attuned shard from one Warp Plate into another Warp Plate's center slot.
