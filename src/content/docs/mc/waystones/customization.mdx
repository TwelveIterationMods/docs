## Changing the Attuned Shard Recipe

The warp plate allows creating additional attuned shards. The recipe is configurable and can be changed by overriding 
the `waystones/recipes/attuned_shard.json` file in a data pack.

```json
{
    "type": "waystones:warp_plate",
    "result": {
        "item": "waystones:attuned_shard",
        "count": 1
    },
    "primary": {
        "item": "minecraft:flint"
    },
    "secondary": [
        {
            "item": "waystones:warp_dust"
        },
        {
            "item": "waystones:warp_dust"
        },
        {
            "item": "waystones:warp_dust"
        },
        {
            "item": "waystones:warp_dust"
        }
    ]
}
```
