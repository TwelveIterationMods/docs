The Cow in a Jar is a genius invention based on the [Milk Jar](milk_jar).

Inside is a tiny cow that will continuously produce milk over time.

Check the [Cooking Table](cooking_table) for more information on multi-block Kitchens.

## Crafting (in-world)

If the above image is not clear enough, I've also made a short instructional video visualizing the process:
