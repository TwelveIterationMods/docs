The Toaster possesses magical heating powers to convert Untoasted Toast to Toast.

It acts as a standalone block and does not provide any further functionality to a multi-block Kitchen.

Note that in order for the toaster to work, a mod adding Toast needs to be installed (e.g. Pam's Harvestcraft).

### Crafting

<CraftingRecipe recipe="cookingforblockheads:toaster"/>

### Usage

Right-click the toaster with a supported type of bread (for Pam's, it's just normal Bread) to put it in. You can put two pieces of bread into the toaster at once.

Right-clicking the toaster again when it's full (or with an empty hand) will start the toasting process. After a little time has passed, the finished toast will pop out at the top.

### Configuration
