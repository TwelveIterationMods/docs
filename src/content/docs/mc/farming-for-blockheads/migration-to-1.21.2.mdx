### Migrate Farming for Blockheads data to 1.21.2+

<NoteBox title="Using data from before 1.20.4?">
This tool can only migrate data that was already updated for the changes in Minecraft 1.20.4+.

If you have older data, try using the [previous migrator](../migration-to-1204) first.
</NoteBox>

### How to migrate presets

"Presets" have been replaced by Defaults, which are hierarchical and managed through a `farmingforblockheads/defaults.json` file in a datapack.

Defaults go from generic to specific, with each part separated by a period.

For example, a modded seed market recipe may specify the default `default.seeds.farmersdelight`, which will lookup a default in order from right-to-left:

- If `defaults.json` defines a default for `default.seeds.farmersdelight`, that will be used.
- Otherwise, if `defaults.json` defines a default for `default.seeds`, that will be used.
- Otherwise, it will fall back to the `default` key that comes shipped with Farming for Blockheads (cost: 1 emerald)

Similarly, you can now enable a whole set of items (e.g. all mushrooms) by adding `default.mushrooms` to your `includedPresets` config option.

Farming for Blockheads will additionally read defaults from the config folder at `config/farmingforblockheads/defaults.json` as an easier alternative to datapacks.
