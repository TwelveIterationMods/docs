### Table of Contents

### Defaults

Defaults are managed in a datapack's `farmingforblockheads/defaults.json` or the `config/farmingforblockheads/defaults.json` file in your config folder.

They are hierarchical going from generic to specific. For example, on a market recipe that defines `defaults` to be `selling.seeds.farmersdelight`:

-   If `defaults.json` defines a default for `selling.seeds.farmersdelight`, that will be used.
-   Otherwise, if `defaults.json` defines a default for `selling.seeds`, that will be used.
-   Otherwise, it will fall back to the `selling` key that comes shipped with Farming for Blockheads (cost: 1 emerald)

### Market Categories

Each Market Category adds a new tab to the Market menu. You can add your own categories by creating a data pack.

Market Categories are stored in a folder called `market_categories` and behave like any other data resource, i.e. they are namespaced and must be referenced as such.

Farming for Blockheads ships with four default categories: `farmingforblockheads:seeds`, `farmingforblockheads:saplings`, `farmingforblockheads:flowers` and `farmingforblockheads:other`.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "tooltip": {
        "translate": "category.farmingforblockheads.flowers"
    },
    "icon": {
        "item": "minecraft:dandelion"
    },
    "sortIndex": 30
}
```

### Market Items

Market Items are the items that are available for purchase in the Market. You can add your own purchaseable items by creating a data pack.

As these items are defined using Minecraft's recipe system, you can also easily use a mod like CraftTweaker to define them via CraftTweaker's `addJsonRecipe()`.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "type": "farmingforblockheads:market",
    "defaults": "selling.spawn_eggs.minecraft",
    "result": {
        "item": "minecraft:cat_spawn_egg"
    }
}
```

It will look up the payment and category from the specified `defaults` key.

You can also specify these fields directly, but that is not recommended for most cases as it will make it more difficult for others to override these fields.

#### NBT / Components and Enchanted Items

```json
{
    "type": "farmingforblockheads:market",
    "result": {
        "item": "minecraft:enchanted_book",
        "components": {
            "minecraft:stored_enchantments": {
                "levels": { "minecraft:wind_burst": 3 }
            },
            "minecraft:custom_name": "[{\"translate\": \"enchantment.minecraft.wind_burst\"}, {\"text\": \" 3\"}]"
        }
    }
}
```
