### Table of Contents

### Editing existing content

By default, Little Joys ships with event "recipes" for all Vanilla content - that means dig spots for most naturally generated blocks, drop rushes for most crops, gold rushes for most ores and fishing spots on water.

These recipes can be manipulated through data packs or other customization mods just like any other recipe.

You can find the default recipes [in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/LittleJoys/tree/1.20.1/common/src/main/resources/data/littlejoys/recipes).

Additionally, the mod comes with loot tables for all dig spots and fishing spots, also [found on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/LittleJoys/tree/1.20.1/common/src/generated/resources/data/littlejoys/loot_tables) for reference.

### Adding additional content

You can also add additional recipes in the same manner as above. Recipes can be weighted and the mod will randomly pick one that matches for the given location.
