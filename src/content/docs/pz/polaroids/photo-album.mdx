- 'Take Photo' option, which will take two screenshots, one with UI enabled, one with it hidden. It will then attempt to open the screenshot folder, or otherwise copy the path to the clipboard. You can upload these somewhere to later print a polaroid out of them.
- 'Print Polaroid' option, which requires you to enter an image URL to create a Polaroid print. It doesn't matter where you've uploaded the picture, though it's good to use a direct link for best results.
- Polaroid Cameras can be found in Electronics Shops, Camera Stores and Electronic Shelves of Gigamart
