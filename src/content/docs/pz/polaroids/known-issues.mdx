### Links do not open in the system's web browser

Unfortunately it seems Project Zomboid is unable to open folders or web URLs directly in the explorer or web browser currently (at least on my Windows 10 system). Therefore it will attempt to open images in the Steam Overlay instead, or copy the URL to the clipboard if nothing worked.
