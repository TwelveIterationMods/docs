The Immersive Whispers sandbox setting optionally replaces the /w command with a distance-based whisper chat. 

Additionally, whispers can be set to be restricted to the room they were spoken in, preventing them from being heard through walls.

However, the room boundary check is fairly simple, so whispers will not transmit through open doors even if you would expect them to.
