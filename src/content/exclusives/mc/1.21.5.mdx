## Preview Releases for Minecraft 1.21.5

<NoteBox title="Older worlds may not migrate correctly">
Minecraft is currently undergoing major changes in how data is stored, which makes forward-compatibility of older worlds tricky for mods.

There is a good chance your older worlds will not migrate correctly to 1.21.5. Your best option is to create a new world.

If you choose to upgrade an old world, it is **strongly recommended** to make a backup of your world before you try updating to any 1.21.5 releases!

If you're looking for long-term stability, consider remaining on Minecraft 1.20.1 for a while longer. Many modders will continue to support that version as LTS until a Minecraft 1.22.x release has settled.

<NoteBox title="Known Issue: Custom model renderers will not display correctly" color="error">
On Fabric, custom models, such as those from Cooking for Blockheads, will not display correctly yet.

<NoteBox title="Supported Mod Loaders" color="info">
- Fabric releases are usually the first to come out, and it's also the only mod loader supported on pre-releases.
- NeoForge releases usually follow within a few days of the full release.
- Forge releases may be delayed. **It is recommended to switch to NeoForge or Fabric.**
