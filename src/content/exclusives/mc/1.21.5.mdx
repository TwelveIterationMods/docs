## Preview Releases for Minecraft 1.21.5

---

<NoteBox title="Older worlds may not migrate correctly">
Minecraft is currently undergoing major changes in how data is stored, which makes forward-compatibility of older worlds tricky for mods.

There is a good chance your older worlds will not migrate correctly to 1.21.5.

If you choose to upgrade an old world, it is **strongly recommended** to make a backup of your world before you try updating to any 1.21.5 releases!

<NoteBox title="Known Issue: Custom model renderers will not display correctly" color="error">
On Fabric, custom models, such as those from Cooking for Blockheads, will not display correctly yet.
</NoteBox>

<NoteBox title="Supported Mod Loaders" color="info">
- Fabric preview releases are usually the first to come out.
- NeoForge preview releases usually follow within a few days of a pre-release.
- Forge does not receive preview releases, and full releases may be delayed. **It is recommended to switch to NeoForge or Fabric.**
