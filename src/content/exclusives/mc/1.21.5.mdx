## Preview Releases for Minecraft 1.21.5

---

<NoteBox title="Older worlds may not migrate correctly">
Minecraft is currently undergoing major changes in how data is stored, which makes forward-compatibility of older worlds tricky for mods.

There is a good chance your older worlds will not migrate correctly to 1.21.5. Your best option is to create a new world.

If you choose to upgrade an old world, it is **strongly recommended** to make a backup of your world before you try updating to any 1.21.5 releases!

If you're looking for long-term stability, consider remaining on Minecraft 1.20.1 for a while longer. Many modders will continue to support that version as LTS until a Minecraft 1.22.x release has settled.
